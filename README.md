## Installation
You must have apache webserver with php 5.x or 7.x with extension sqlite3 and curl enabled.

sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php php-sqlite3 php-curl

extract directory xmrig-proxy to your webserver root

Sqlite Database directory shall be owned by www-data

sudo chown www-data /var/www/html/xmrig-proxy/php/

Add cronjob every 5 min to your crontab

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/xmrig-proxy/php/cron.php

You must set an access token and set "restricted": false to the xmrig-proxy config.json

## Settings
Change http path in php/cron.php according to your webserver configuration

$php_path = "http://<i></i>127.0.0.1/xmrig-proxy";

Add proxies ip, port, token authorization and app_password in php/config.php

$proxy_list[0] = array("ip"=>"127.0.0.1", "port"=>"8000", "token"=>"SECRET", "label"=>"YOUR PROXY 1 LABEL");

$proxy_list[1] = array("ip"=>"127.0.0.1", "port"=>"8200", "token"=>"SECRET", "label"=>"YOUR PROXY 2 LABEL");

$app_password = "SECRET";

The app_password is the password asked when you open webapp. 

## Usage
For pool change , add all your pools to the xmrig-proxy config.json and select one from within the webapp.

-This is not working currently. Proxys config.json gets 0 for the port setting in http part of config.json. Problem seems to be in xmrig-proxy and how it writes out the config.json as the json passed to proxy has the port in it correctly.

Percentage change :

percentage is calculate on day (1440 min) , if you put 10% on pool#1 and 90% on pool#2 then proxy will stay on pool#1 for 144 mins and on pool#2 for 1296 mins.

Time change:

miner stay on pool for defined hours then swap to next pools.
